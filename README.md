# React redux playground

Used for experimenting with redux in various forms, some from tutorials others independent.

## Branches

Each branch covers a different aspect/approach to building a basic counter app, main contains the stripped out react app only

### Notes - react-redux

- Uses redux and react-redux packages
- This is uses the outdated `createStore` method which is being deprecated in favour of redux toolkit (for learning purposes only)

## Available Scripts

```
npm start
```

```
npm test
```

```
npm run build
```
